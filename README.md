### Ethernet Packet Generator 

This C++ project involves generating and streaming Ethernet packets with configurable burst properties. 
The program ensures 4-byte packet alignment, discards incomplete packets, and adds padding with Inter-Frame Gaps (IFGs), 
outputting the packets in a structured, aligned format.
